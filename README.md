# Slidev-Quiz WebSocket Server

WebSocker server for the [Slidev-Quiz](https://github.com/jsbrittain/slidev-quiz) demo. At time of publication this was deployed at [slidev-quiz-server.onrender.com](https://slidev-quiz-server.onrender.com), spinning up for 15mins when accessed (spin-up can take up to 1 min, but in practise has been <10secs). To launch locally clone and run `node server.js`.
